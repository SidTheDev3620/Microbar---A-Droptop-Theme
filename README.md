Microbar - A Droptop theme by SidTheDev

I am kind of an odd guy. I don't like aesthetics that much. I prefer a minimalist setup on my desktop. After not finding a Droptop theme that suited me, I decided to create
a theme based on Big Sur dark by Yaron for myself.

This theme is for anyone who would perfer a VERY SMALL droptop bar with NO aesthetic. It's very minimalistic with no BG and no borders. When using Mini 1 setting, 
It'll be so small that it may not be readable on small monitors.

Here's a preview of the theme with Mini 1 setting:-

I publised this for anyone as insane as me to try it. I hope you like it :)
